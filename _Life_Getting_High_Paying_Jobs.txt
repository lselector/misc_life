How to get High-Paying Jobs.

I want to talk about getting high-paying jobs.
I have helped many people over the years.
And developed a certain methodology.

Here are the main foundational ideas:
========================================
There is no stability.
Average job duration was less than 2 years for a long time.

========================================
The technologies change fast.
You need to learn new stuff to be marketable.
You have to change, to adapt.
To educate yourself into employment.

You need to be on the front of the wave to receive high rate/salary.

Any new job type becomes a "blue collar" job in just few years
with average/low commodity pay.

Most people don't educate themselves until they are forced to do so.
So they are not increasing their salary.
In fact, their effective compensation may go down, and competition increase.

Nowadays you have to compete also
 - against remote outsorced people in other countries
 - against computers (automation, cloud, AI)

Many jobs are becoming extinct.
For example, the number of human traders at financial companies
has fallen down to about 1% of what it used to be.

========================================
There is tactics and strategy.

Tactics is specific steps you are taking. 
Tactics changes all the time.

Strategy is a long-term direction. A vision.
You need to select direction carefully.

Tactically you solve problem how to pay your bills this month.

Strategically you plan how you will be living in 3-5 or more years from now.

People tend to overestimate what they can do short term (in 3 months),
and under-estimate what they can achieve long-term (in 3-5-10 years).

You need to set a strategic direction.
For me it is Machine Learning and AI (Artificial intelligence).

========================================
Interesting example - Prashant Reddy:
 - http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ppr/
 - https://www.linkedin.com/in/prashantreddy
 - https://www.facebook.com/prashantreddy

In ~2009 he has left his 7-figure income at Morgan Stanley,
and has become a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon 
in the area of Machine Learning.
He has later gone to Google and J.P. Morgan.

This is a very interesting example of staying on strategic course.
Usually people don't want to sacrifice their high salaries.
But - he did.

========================================
Once you decided on your strategic direction, you
need to find examples of people who you can use
as role models.

The easiest way to achieve success is to follow someone else's steps.

Venturing into a new field is like stepping on a minefield.
You don't know where the mines are.

But if you have someone who knows how to cross the field,
then you can repeat his success simply by following his steps.

Some knowledge you can find by searching (googling) for it.
For some knowledge you should pay.
But this is always a good investment.

========================================
Educate yourself "in advance". Be proactive.
If you educate yourself proactively in advance - you will be ahead of the crowd.
You will have little or no competition - and will receive higher salary.
Think in terms of studying in a college.
If you learn 2 weeks in advance - you get high grades.
If you learn 2 weeks late - you get low grades.
Over a period of 5 years the shift of 2 weeks is only 2/(5*50) ~ 1 percent.
But this 1% shift in timing may result in 100% .. 500% shift in salary in real life.

========================================
Catch-22:
     to get a job you need experience,
     to get experience you need a job.
You always have this problem, because technologies change.
So next job may require technology which you haven't used on your previous job.

There are only two ways to break out of this catch-22 cycle:
      1. get real experience
      2. get some education - and convince that you are really excited and can do the job.

In most cases I was using p.2

========================================
I had a friend who always felt that he needs to study more.
To get more courses, more certifications.

But if you don't go out and do the interviews, nothing happen.

Suppose you have studied for 3 months and now you are 70% ready.
If you study for another 3 months - you may be 75% ready.
But if you instead spend this time on going on interviews,
you would probably get a job by now.

More studying will increase your chances by 5%.
More interviewing will increase your chances by 100%.

========================================
I knew a guy who was absolutely useless at work,
but he was complaining that he is not paid enough,
so he was constantly going on interviews.
Result - he was getting high-paying jobs.
And adding them to his resume.
So he was paid more than people around him.
But - he was useless at work, not productive.

Those who study - don't get jobs.

Those who go on interviews - get jobs and more money.
And once you get a job - you will learn new stuff
on the job while getting paid.

So, do not procrastinate - just get a job.

========================================
You need to accept that during the interview
there will be questions which you can not answer.

You never can prepare for everything.
All companies are different.
All systems and processes are different.

Consider interviews as a learning experience.
Ask questions, take notes, write down terms,
then go home and google them, learn about them,
maybe add to your resume.

Going on interviews is like a free education.
You meet with experienced high-paid professionals
who talk and ask questions about your area of interest.
This is a great opportunity to learn from them.

========================================
Interview is the transfer of energy.
You must have energy, excitement.
Your top-paying skills are NOT your technical skills, but your enthusiasm.

I have learned this lesson almost 20 years ago from Charly McAliley
He was making $300/hour when I was making $115/hour
He explained to me why he was paid much more.

Read this book:
      How I Raised Myself from Failure to Success in Selling - by Frank Bettger
      - https://www.amazon.com/Raised-Myself-Failure-Success-Selling/dp/067179437X

It is translated into Russian:

========================================
It is much easier to pass the interview for a skill which is NEW.

If you would try to pass an interview for a commodity skill
(today it would be Java, Javascript, etc. ),
the interviewers will shred you into small pieces.
the older the technology - the stronger the competition,
and more difficult is the interview.

But for a new technology you can pass the interview by simply talking
in general terms.

Managers need a specialist in new technology.
They have a problem a headache - which they can not resolve themselves.
They don't know this technology themselves.
And they have difficulty finding specialists.

If you demonstrate that you:
 - know about this technology
 - really like it and excited about it
 - know the basics (what it is, terminology, people, vendors, tools, use cases, ...)
the managers will decide that you are the good person for this job.
 - pass the "alive" test (breathing at the mirror)
...
you are hired on the spot.

So here is the formula:
  - do research - find new and in high-demand skills
  - learn basics - terminology (dictionary), ... to be able
to answer basic questions. This takes 1-60 days depending on complexity.

This will allow you to pass the interview.
And then in 3 months on the job you get real experience!

========================================
Do NOT be afraid of learning new stuff.
Do NOT try to grow incrementally from your previous experience.
Rather make your research, find what is needed - and pull yourself to it.

Most people define themselves by their prior experience.
This is the huge mistake.
Because the progress is disruptive.
In order to make space for new stuff - you need to get rid of old stuff.

It is possible (in fact it is easy) to re-define and re-position yourself
in just few months.
Remember - you don't need to become a true experienced specialist.
You just need to become a "reporter" who knows about the subject,
can navigate terminology, and demonstrate excitement.

========================================
Market yourself by your positioning, not by chasing opportunities.

Position yourself as "obvious expert" so that people can find you.

Publish materials on a subject:
  - book(s), articles, posts
  - youtube videos, podcasts, other social media
  - LinkedIn posts, articles, etc.
  - teach and make courses 
  - conferences (videos, abstracts)
  - GitHub
  - etc.

Most people never do that.
So by doing this you immediately put yourself in the top 0.01%
and way ahead of the competition.
(I am guilty of not doing this enough myself.)

========================================
Teaching others is a great way to educate yourself.
Become an educator, an evangelist of new stuff.

========================================
Looking for a job is all about time management.
You need to create your marketing funnel.
  N1 people found you
  N2 people contacted you for preliminary conversation
  N3 people submitted you for a job
  N4 companies decided to invite you for an interview
  N5 companies decided to invite to 2nd, ... interview
  N6 companies gave you a job offer

Apparently N1 >> N2 > N3 ... > N6
So majority of your time will be spent on N1, N2 - unless you
will find a way to effectively automate it.
If you get enough visibility and traffic for N1, N2,... - then job offers will follow automatically.

========================================
It is easier to learn new stuff together.
Over the years I have done it in various ways:
 - Learning together (book reading club, courses, ... )
 - Making presentations - and publish (website, blog, github, youtube, ...)

========================================
To look for a job is a job in itself.
It is a skill that you need to learn, to educate yourself.
How many books have you read on the subject of looking for a job?
Have you passed any exams/tests on the subject?

Suppose you need to undergo a brain surgery.
And you find that your surgeon hasn't read even a single book about medicine.
Will you be willing to pay him to do a surgery on you?

So how can you become successful in finding jobs
if you haven't educated yourself in how to do it?

You don't need to be a superhero to find a job.
All you need is to follow certain proven steps.
You need to learn it.

========================================
The technology of finding jobs changes.
People used to answer ads in newspapers,
sending paper letters in mail, or calling on the phone.

Nowadays people mostly use Internet.
But - there are different methods here as well.
Which methods are more effective?

I recommend this book:
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Color_Is_Your_Parachute%3F

"It has been in print since 1970 and has been revised
annually since 1975, sometimes substantially."

In Russian:
 - http://flibusta.is/b/606652

Also you need to study marketing.

I recommend Joe Polish, for example:
 - https://geniusnetwork.com/giverbook/
 - https://ilovemarketing.com/
This is a gateway into literally hundreds of great sources.

========================================
Resume and Linkedin

Nowadays companies search candidates on Linkedin.
If you recommend someone to HR (Human Resource),
they will immediately search this person on Linkedin.

Resume and Linkedin should correspond to each other.

Both should contain a short summary at the top.

Spend 90% of your effort on this top summary.
Because nobody reads the whole resume or Linkedin profile.

But people read the top (summary).
So spend most of your attention on the title and summary.
This is your positionning.

========================================
Give yourself a title that corresponds to what you want to become.
For example, if you are looking for a position of a Data Scientist,
name yourself as a Data Scientist.

Once you start talking about yourself as a Data Scientist,
your outlook changes, your confidence increases, etc.

What does it mean to be a Data Scientist ?
It doesn't mean to go to college and get a degree.
It simply means that you can do what average Data Scientists are doing.

A minimalistic definition: 
you need to know how to:
  - get data - SQL or from CSV file
  - explore data (Excel, Jupyter notebook, etc.)
  - run some simple model (Linear Regression)
  - evaluate model quality (accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC curve, etc.)
  - make PowerPoint presentation

There are multiple projects on Github, Medium, etc.
Take one of them, reproduce step-by-step.
Done.
You are a minimalistic Data Scientist.

========================================
Get recommendations for your linkedin profile.
At least 5-10, but 40-50 is better.
People trust when they see positive reviews (recommendations).

This is similar to a trust people experience when
they see positive 5-star reviews on amazon.

So - present yourself as a 5-stars "product" using recommendations.

========================================
