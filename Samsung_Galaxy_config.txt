Samsung Galaxy Note 10 configuration
December 2019
----------------------------
Note - do not install Samsung (security)
  system updates until you do backup.
Note - when selecting PIN, click an option 
  "Confirm PIN without tapping OK"
----------------------------
Normally to answer the phone you need to swipe 
button to center of screen (if big buttons),
or simply press (if small "buttons"). 
You can configure phone to always use a single 
tap by enabling "assistant menu":

Single tap to answer
      Settings 
        -> Accessibility 
          -> Interaction and dexterity  
            -> Assistant menu [on] 
              -> Single tap to swipe [on] 

Note - this setting will keep a small round 
"assistant menu" button floating around. 
To remove it, press it - and drug to the "X" button. 
It will probably re-appear twice a day,
you will have to remove it again.
