Plant Based Keto Diet

A friend of mine used this diet 
to lose 140 lbs in 1 year.

A Plant Keto Diet is a very good, 
easy to follow and healthy way of eating 
which makes it easy to lose weight, 
and maintain weight while being healthy. 

Ketones are produced when your body breaks down fat.
The main idea of this diet is 
to avoid glucose (sweet taste, glycogen), 
thus forcing body to start using its own fat as energy source.

It is similar to Atkin's diet, but without meat. 
You eat mostly plant foods (and some fish).

No meat, chicken, eggs, all milk products
No sweet taste, no sugar/glycogen rich products
No bread/wheat, rice, oats, grains (quinoa, buckweat, Amaranth, cereals,  ...)
